#### Business Problem
Yelp, established in 2004, has grown into one of the leading platforms for local business discovery and reviews, serving as a critical bridge between businesses and consumers. With millions of reviews and business listings, Yelp offers a rich dataset that provides insights into consumer preferences, business performance, and market dynamics. 

Utilizing the Yelp dataset for analyzing business onboarding standards presents a compelling opportunity for enhancing the symbiotic relationship between the platform and its associated businesses. The primary objective is to dissect the multitude of factors influencing the star ratings on Yelp, ranging from customer reviews, ratings, location, and service categories, to the nuances of customer engagement and response strategies. 

The analysis of Yelp’s extensive dataset seeks to address the critical challenge of assessing store quality and enhancing the recommendation system by focusing on the diverse features that influence a business’s star ratings. By delving into factors such as customer reviews, service categories, and engagement strategies, this study aims to refine onboarding criteria and best practices for businesses, ensuring a high-quality and diverse selection for users. Ultimately, this effort intends to bolster a symbiotic relationship between Yelp and its associated businesses, fostering an ecosystem where both parties thrive and contribute to a richer, more engaging platform.
